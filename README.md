## Type ORM practice

A quick mock up of Type ORM functionality based on this tutorial -https://codeburst.io/typeorm-by-example-part-7-97025823adff

Includes Redis and all basic join relationships

I love the migration generation and it's a lot easier than other ORMS ie Active record etc.

TODOS
- fix lint errors, the generators don't format properly
- figure out json serialisation
- add search
- add authentication
